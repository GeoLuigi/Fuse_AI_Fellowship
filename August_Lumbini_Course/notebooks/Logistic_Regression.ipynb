    "### Why linear Regression Cannot Be used For Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>The output of a linear regression model is continuous and unbounded.</li>\n",
    "<li>This means that it can take any value along the real number line, which is not appropriate for categorical labels that have a finite set of discrete values.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Linear regression assumes that the relationship between the input variables and the output variable is linear.</li>\n",
    "<li>However, in classification tasks, the relationship between the input variables and the class labels is often nonlinear, making it an unsuitable choice.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>In contrast, classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and SVMs are designed specifically for categorical classification tasks.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/linear_vs_logistic.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>The Value of Y can exceed 1 and go below 0 if we use linear regression.</li>\n",
    "<li>But, we want an output as a probability of occurrence of the expected output(either 1 or 0). With this probability, we should be able to classify the output.</li>\n",
    "<li>The regression line we get from Linear Regression is highly sensitive to outliers.</li>\n",
    "<li>If the number of outliers relative to non-outlier data points is more than a few, then the model will be skewed away from the true underlying relationship.</li>\n",
    "<li>Thus it will not do a good job in classifying two classes.</li>"

    "### What Is Logistic Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Logistic regression is a statistical method used to predict the probability of an event occurring based on input variables.</li>\n",
    "<li>It is a form of regression analysis, which means it estimates the relationship between the input variables and the output variable.</li>\n",
    "<li>The output of logistic regression is a probability value between 0 and 1, which represents the likelihood of the event occurring given the input variables.</li>\n",
    "<li>This probability can be converted into a binary classification by setting a threshold value.</li>\n",
    "<li>For example, if the threshold is set to 0.5, we can classify observations with a predicted probability greater than or equal to 0.5 as \"positive\".</li>\n",
    "<li>And those with a predicted probability less than 0.5 as \"negative.\"</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Logistic regression is widely used in various fields such as marketing, healthcare, and finance, to make predictions and decisions based on probabilities.</li>\n",
    "<li>It is a powerful tool for analyzing data and making informed decisions based on the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.</li>\n",

    "\n",
    "<li>The loss function used in logistic regression is the logistic loss function, also known as the cross-entropy loss function.</li>\n",

    "\n",
    "**The logistic loss function is defined as:**\n",

    "\n",
    "<li>y is the true binary label (0 or 1) of the observation</li>\n",
    "<li>y' is the predicted probability of the observation being in class 1 (i.e., the dependent variable taking the value 1)</li>\n",
    "<li>The logistic loss function penalizes the model more for larger prediction errors (i.e., when the predicted probability is far from the true label).</li>\n",
    "<li>When the predicted probability is close to the true label, the loss function is small, indicating a good fit.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>The goal of logistic regression is to minimize the total logistic loss function over all the training examples.</li>\n",
    "<li>This can be achieved through an optimization algorithm such as gradient descent.</li>\n",
